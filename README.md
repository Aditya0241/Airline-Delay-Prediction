## Abstract

In this machine learning project, we aim to develop a model that can predict the
probability of airline delays based on various features, such as weather conditions,
flight route, aircraft type, and historical data on airline performance.
Also Compare the Machine Learning classification algorithm when predicting flight
delays.
